\title{
An incremental feature selection algorithm for gene expression profile

}
\description{
iFes expands the screening targets in each step of the forward stepwise algorithm, and proposes a novel feature selection algorithm iFes with both high accuracies and low feature numbers. Logistic regression classification algorithm is utilized to measure how good the currently chosen feature subset is.
